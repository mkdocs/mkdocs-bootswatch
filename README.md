## Contributing

These themes all inherit from the `mkdocs` theme which ships with MkDocs. These
themes primarily contain CSS which replaces/overrides the CSS in the `mkdocs`
theme.  All other improvements should be made to the `mkdocs` theme in the
project hosted at <https://github.com/mkdocs/mkdocs>.
