# Theme Examples

This page is full of examples so you can see how this theme renders different
aspects of the documentation.

## Code highlighting

Here is a Python code block.

```python
a,b = 0,1
def fib():
    global a,b
    while True:
        a,b = b, a+b
        yield a
```

This is an example of inline code: `f = fib()` and `f.next()`.

You can also use inline code as a link: [`index.md`](index.md)
